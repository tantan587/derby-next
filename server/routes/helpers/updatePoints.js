/*
The process:
First, pull the point structure.
Next, pull the team standings.
Update the points based on the standings, by sport. Put this into an array.
Next, only update points that have changed. Compare points from points.team_info table, for that scoring structure.
Update the team points in the database that have changed.


Should we have the points as three types: regular season points, playoff points, bonus points?
