<B>8) Payment Terms for Premium Services; Free Trials</B>
<Top />
While registration for any Premium Services is not required for participation in Derby Fantasy, we may offer you Premium Services from time to time to access enhanced or customizable features to Derby Fantasy. We reserve the right to charge a signup fee (“Fee” or “Fees”) in consideration of a periodic subscription or access to such Premium Services. Payment of a Fee for Premium Services entitles you to the services that you choose through the end of the game cycle for which you register. You will be required to provide a credit card or another digital payment form, which we may accept in our sole discretion. Upon registration, we will bill your credit card or other payment form for the Premium Service for which you register. ALL SALES ARE FINAL; SERVICES AND PURCHASES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE, EXCEPT THAT WE WILL REFUND CHARGES MADE IN OUR ERROR OR FOR ANY SERVICES WE TERMINATE AS DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS 3 AND 18.
<Top />
Premium Services are subject to the following terms:
<Indent>(i)We reserve the right to publish additional terms to which you must agree before you may make use of any such Premium Services. Such additional terms, if any, will be made available to you at the time you register for the particular Premium Service.</Indent>
<Indent>(ii) If you register for Premium Services, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information. You have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. You acknowledge that we may restrict or terminate access to Premium Services in the event of nonpayment due to an expired payment method.</Indent>
<Indent>(iii) Some Premium Services may include third-party products or services requiring separate purchase or use. If so, your purchase and use will be subject to the providing third party’s own terms and conditions of use and privacy policy. We cannot and do not represent and warrant any particular third party’s policies, so you should read them before agreeing to them.</Indent>
<Indent>(iv) If your jurisdiction requires a minimum age in order to make a legal agreement to purchase, you represent that you meet such requirement. Taxes and fees may be charged as necessary and applicable (“Taxes”). You agree to pay both the purchase price and Taxes for the particular Premium Service. Purchases tied to your account are your responsibility, whether you or anyone to whom you provide authority makes the particular purchase. We cannot guarantee refunds for purchases made by third parties who access your account due to your own failure to protect your password or other authentication factors.</Indent>
<Indent>(v) Consummation of a purchase of a Premium Service constitutes your authority and direction for us to charge your chosen payment method. If that payment method fails, we may charge an alternate payment method if you have one on file with your account. Failure or denial of your payment method does not waive your obligation to pay any charges you choose to incur. You authorize us to retain or store your payment information as may be required by law or our own business needs after your purchase is completed, though we have no obligation or duty to do so. If any additional surcharges are incurred due to your chosen method or payment, you acknowledge and agree to pay those surcharges and that we have no obligation to do so.</Indent>
<Indent>(vi) We reserve the right to engage in any fraud protection or verification services necessary to complete your transaction.</Indent>
<Indent>(vii) Except where otherwise prohibited by law, we reserve the right to use auto-renewal for Premium Services. You have the right to cancel any auto-renewal Premium Services with at least 48 hours’ notice before the end of the current period. If you choose not to cancel, your access to the Premium Service at issue will renew at the standard price offered at that time, and all charges will be made via the payment method you submitted to us. If more than one Premium Service renews at the same time, we may charge them separately or jointly in our sole discretion.</Indent>
<Indent>(viii) Any discounts, promotions or free trials (“Promotions”) will be offered in our sole discretion, to particular users, for particular times, with no guarantees of availability for any user at any time. Please refer to the specific terms and conditions of any such Promotions.</Indent>
<Indent>(ix) You may cancel a Premium Service at any time through your account, though charges already incurred will not be refundable.</Indent>
<Indent>(x) We may change our fees and billing methods at any time, with or without notice or cause subject to applicable law, though we will strive to provide advance notice whenever possible. You may cancel your access to any affected Premium Services as your sole remedy prior to the change taking place; continued use of the Premium Services after the changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</Indent>
<Indent>(xi) If any charges remain unpaid after 30 days from the date they became due, we may terminate or suspend your account for Premium Services. Should we need to incur attorneys’ fees or collection fees, you will be liable for payment of those fees.</Indent>
<Indent>(xii) If you believe that there are billing problems or discrepancies with your account, please contact us at <Link href='mailto:derby-fwl@gmail.com'>derby-fwl@gmail.com</Link> as soon as possible so that we may resolve them with you. If you do not contact us within 90 days of the date that they post to your billing method’s statement, you waive your right to dispute the discrepancy.</Indent>

<B>21) Disputes; Governing Law</B>
<Top />

<Indent>(1) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH DERBY FANTASY AND THE PREMIUM SERVICES, OR ANY PRIZE AWARDED (IF ANY), WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH BELOW, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION;</Indent>
<Indent>(2) ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS AND AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL THIRD-PARTY, OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS INCURRED (IF ANY) AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES WILL NOT BE AWARDED OR RECOVERABLE IN ARBITRATION UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THE CLAIMS ARE FRIVOLOUS;</Indent>
<Indent>(3) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY ENTRANT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN ANY AWARD FOR, AND ENTRANT HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO SEEK, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS AND/OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES (OTHER THAN ACTUAL OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES), AND/OR ANY RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED; AND</Indent>

<Top />
<B>22) Dispute Resolution</B>
  <Top />
	<Indent><B>(i) Initial Dispute Resolution</B></Indent>
<Top />
<I>We strive to address concerns you may have regarding Derby Fantasy quickly to your satisfaction. However, should a matter arise, we and you shall use our and your best efforts through this process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement via good faith negotiation (“Initial Dispute Resolution”), which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</I>
<Top />
  <Indent><B>(ii) Arbitration</B></Indent>
<Top />
If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
<Top />
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<Top />
The rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. The arbitration rules may also permit you to recover attorneys’ fees in some cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
<Top />
Arbitration will take place in Cook County, Illinois.
<Top />
  <Indent><B>(iii) Class Action Waiver</B></Indent>
<Top />
The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND DERBY FANTASY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
<Top />
  <Indent><B>(iv) Exceptions for Resolution of Intellectual Property Claims</B></Indent>
<Top />
Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” refers to patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
<Top />
  <Indent><B>(v) Opt Out Right</B></Indent>
<Top />
<I>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: <Link href='mailto:derbyfwl@gmail.com'>derbyfwl@gmail.com</Link>. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first creation of an account for any Derby Fantasy Services; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</I>
<Top />
  <Indent><B>(vi) Jurisdiction and Venue; Governing Law</B></Indent>
<Top />
For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Derby FWL agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in Cook County, Illinois. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
